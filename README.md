**MY PORTFOLIO PROJECT**

_**Overview**_: This project is part of the Google-Udacity Nanodegree program, Frontend development track.
          I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and I had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. 
          Specifically, I had to develop a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each 
          of the portfolio projects I will complete throughout the course of my Nanodegree program.
          Finally, I could take the time to personalize my portfolio with custom colors, additional content and my own images.

_**Project Development**_: This Project must meet certain specifications as described below:

 **1. Design**
 
- The project at minimum includes all of the following:

       a)at least 4 images
 
        b)title text (h1, h2, etc.)
 
        c)regular (paragraph) text
 
        d)a logo.
 
- Use HTML5 semantic tags, such as header, footer etc, to add meaning to the code. 

- No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a CSS class or id.

- Provide at least one of the following customizations:

        a)Customize images and text.

        b)Customize placement of the elements on the page (grid layout) with HTML, CSS or both.

        c)Customize CSS styles applied at minimum to paragraph and heading elements.      

- Page utilizes a grid-based layout with styles making use of the flexbox layout or a framework like Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.                        

**2. Responsiveness**

- All content is responsive and displays on all display sizes. This includes Desktop, Google Nexus 5 (mobile) and Apple iPad (Tablet).

- An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.

- All content is rendered on all three devices. No content should be hidden on mobile devices.

- Viewport meta tag is included in HTML. 

- If a CSS framework is used, classes provided by the CSS framework are used to make images responsive, otherwise media-queries are used to ensure responsiveness of images.


 **3. Separation of Concerns**
 
Portfolio completely separates structure (HTML) from design/style (CSS). There are no style attributes present in the body of the HTML document. There are no <style> elements in the document.

Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on functionality.


**4. Code Quality**

The code must follow Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree style guide concerning HTML and CSS Formatting and style rules as well as General meta rules and General Formatting rules.You can find the guide here: http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/
